        <h1>About Version Control</h1>
        <p>
            What is "version control" and what is used for? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or a few files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a Version Control System (VCS) allows you to revert selected files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you ruin something or lose some files, you can easily recover.
        </p>
        <h2 style="color: #007BFF;">Local Version Control Systems</h2>
        <p>
            Many people’s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory. This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error-prone. It is easy to forget which directory you’re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don’t mean to. To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.
        </p>
      <h2 style="color: #007BFF;">Centralized Version Control Systems</h2>
        <p>
            The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems. To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed. These systems (such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce) have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. For many years, this has been the standard for version control.
        </p>
        <p>
            This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs. For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing. Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what, and it’s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.
        </p>
      <h2 style="color: #007BFF;">Distributed Version Control Systems</h2>
        <p>
            In a DVCS (Distributed Version Control Systems, such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don’t just check out the latest snapshot of the files; rather, they fully mirror the repository, including its full history. Thus, if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via that server, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it. Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.
        </p>
      <h2 style="color: #007BFF;">History of Git</h2>
        <p>
            During the early years of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files. In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool’s free-of-charge status was revoked. This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper. Some of the goals of the new system were:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Speed</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Simple design</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Fully distributed</li>
            <li style="font-size: 1.2rem;">Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
           Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities. It’s amazingly fast, it’s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development.
        </p>
      <h2 style="color: #007BFF;">Git VS other VCSs</h2>
        <p>
            Even though Git’s user interface is fairly similar to these other VCSs, Git stores and thinks about information in a very different way, and understanding these differences will help you avoid becoming confused while using it.
        </p>
        <p>
            The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data. Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes. These other systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they store as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time (this is commonly described as delta-based version control).
        </p>
        <p>
            Git doesn’t think of or store its data this way. Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a series of snapshots of a miniature filesystem. With Git, every time you commit, or save the state of your project, Git basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot. To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn’t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored. Git thinks about its data more like a stream of snapshots.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most operations in Git need only local files and resources to operate — generally no information is needed from another computer on your network. If you’re used to a CVCS where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers. Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.
